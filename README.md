# POInt

POInt is a content sharing app that draws museum visitorsâ€™ attention to specific "points of interest" in the art objects around them.

This app is written using the Ionic framework, and can be run on both iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

To use this app you'll have to install Ionic (a Cordova-based platform for writing mobile apps using Angular.js)

```
npm install -g cordova ionic
npm install
```

We use Gulp to automate our build process (combining JavaScript files, compiling SCSS into CSS, etc.).

To watch for changes and recompile, run:

```
gulp watch
```

## Testing with Browser

Most of the app (except the iBeacon functionality) can be tested in the browser using this command:

```
ionic serve
```

This will open a browser window running the app.

## Testing with iOS Simulator

```
ionic build ios
ionic emulate ios
```

## Deplying to an iOS Device

You'll have to configure an iOS Developer Account first.

```
ionic build ios
ionic run ios --device
```
